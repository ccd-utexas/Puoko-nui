==================== INSTALL PICAM ==================== 
Download and install PICAM from
ftp://ftp.piacton.com/Public/Software/Official/PICam/PICam%20Install.exe


==================== INSTALL USB DRIVER ==================== 
Download libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0.zip from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0.zip/download

Attach timer unit to USB port
Windows may pop up a dialog saying it couldn't install a driver - We are about to fix that.

Extract libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0.zip and run bin\inf-wizard.exe
Select the timer unit from the list of USB devices. It should show up with Vendor ID 0x403, Product ID 0x6001, Description "USB <-> Serial"
Select a location to save the resulting .inf, anywhere (eg the Desktop) is fine. You can delete it once we're done with the installation
Select Install Now from the next dialog
Allow the driver to install if windows shows an "Unsigned Driver" warning
(Optional) Check that it shows up correctly in the Device Manager - it should appear as "USB <-> Serial" under "libusb-win32 devices".


==================== RUN ====================
Make sure that the logs directory exists in the same location as puokonui.exe, it won't run if it isn't present.
Double click puokonui.exe to run it - it should pop up a console window.


==================== NOTES ====================
 - IMPORTANT: Don't click inside the terminal window, this will cause it to freeze up. This seems to be a bug with ncurses under windows or perhaps the windows commandline shell

 - Make sure to reset the frame dir to a location that exists before enable saving frames (ctrl-p then ctrl-s. Set to . to select the program dir)

 - The demo camera functionality doesn't support all the functions used, so I haven't been able to test image acquisition.
   Expect there to be problems for the first few program iterations. Send me the log file (in \logs, named by start time) and i'll try and fix them,
   or check BUILD-WIN64.txt for instructions on setting up the toolchain if you want to fix them yourselves

 - The ability to set readout speed isn't implemented, so it will use whatever the default rate is (probably 1MHz)

 - Online preview of frames with ds9 isn't implemented. You'll need to save them and the open them manually for now

 - The timer is set up to use a constant startup and shutdown delay to work around bugs in our ST133 camera.
   You can tweak the delays by changing TimerStartDelay and TimerStopDelay in preferences.dat

 - UseTimerMonitor is set to 0 in preferences.dat (the default is 1). The unit you have lacks the monitoring hardware, so this must remain disabled
