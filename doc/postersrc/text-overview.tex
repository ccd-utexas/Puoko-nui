% high speed precision time series photometer?
\item[] Puoko-nui is a precision time series photometer developed at Victoria
University of Wellington, primarily for use with the 1m McLellan
telescope at Mt John University Observatory (MJUO), Lake Tekapo, New Zealand.
It has been operating in its current form since early 2011.

\item[] The initial design concept for the photometer was inspired by an
earlier instrument (Argos) developed at the University of Texas in Austin.
Puoko-nui features a modular design which replaces the parallel port timer
dongle in Argos with a separate programmable hardware unit to provide a clean
separation of timing and acquisition, and allow for much greater flexibility
in operation.
