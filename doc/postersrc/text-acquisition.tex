\item[] The instrument control and online reduction software is run on a pair of
compact ``net-top'' PCs situated adjacent to the telescope and controlled via a remote
connection. One PC runs the acquisition and online reduction software
in an Ubuntu GNU/Linux environment. The other runs the proprietary SBIG
acquisition/autoguiding software in a Microsoft Windows environment.

\item[] The acquisition software provides facilities for setting image metadata
(target name, observers, etc) and configuring run parameters such as exposure
time and CCD temperature.

\item[] The software acts as a passive receiver once an acquisition run
commences, tagging each frame with the GPS timestamp and image metadata. 
Frames are saved to disk as compressed FITS files.
