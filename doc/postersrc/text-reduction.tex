\item[] We have also created a software package for online reduction and analysis
of Puoko-nui data, called \texttt{tsreduce}.

%\item[] We have developed a robust set of online reduction and analysis
%software for Puoko-nui, called \texttt{tsreduce}.

\item[] \texttt{tsreduce} performs aperture photometry on selected target and
comparison stars. The intrinsic variation in the target star (measured in
milli-modulation amplitudes; 10\,mma~=~1\% change) is determined by taking the
ratio of the target and comparison intensities, then subtracting a low-order 
polynomial fit to\\remove any residual long-period effects.

\item[] Frames are processed immediately after acquisition, keeping an up to date
graphical display of the raw lightcurves for each star, and a lightcurve and Fourier
amplitude spectrum of the intrinsic target intensity.

\item[] Offline analysis functionality includes routines for optimizing aperture size,
BJD timestamp corrections, and Fourier analysis techniques including prewhitening.

%\item[] Source code (GPLv3 licensed) is available online at
%\url{https://github.com/pchote/tsreduce}
