\begin{itemize}[itemsep=20pt]

\item[] Exposure timing is controlled by a custom-built unit based around the
ATmega1284p microcontroller. Timing information is received from an external
GPS receiver via RS232 and a 1\,Hz edge-aligned time pulse.

\item[] Camera readouts are triggered via a BNC cable connection, with a second
connection used for monitoring the camera status. Communication with the
acquisition PC is via USB.

\item[] The main timer firmware supports two external GPS units; the
Trimble Thunderbolt, and an older Magellan OEM receiver. Support for additional
GPS receivers can be added with minimal effort.

\item[] An alternative timer firmware provides a ``high-speed'' timing mode:
the 1\,Hz GPS time signal disciplines an internal timer,
allowing sub-second exposures with a timing resolution of 10\,ms.
