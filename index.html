		<h3>White Dwarf Stars</h3>
		<div class="imageRow" style="float:right; margin-right:5px;"><div class="single">
		  <a href="images/mjuo.jpg" rel="lightbox[images]" title="PC &amp; DJS with the VUW system mounted on the 1m telescope at MJUO"><img src="images/mjuo_thumb.jpg" width="150" /></a>
		</div></div>
		<p align="justify">
			Stars exist as a balance between gravity and the outflow of energy created from
			nuclear fusion within their core.  When a star runs out of nuclear fuel it
			will evolve into a small and extremely dense stellar remnant: a white dwarf,
			neutron star, or black hole.  The vast majority of stars (over 97%) are predicted
			to end their lives as a white dwarf.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			The forces sustaining a white dwarf are dominated by quantum and relativistic effects.
			They contain a core about the size of the Earth	which contains a classical gas of
			nuclides (mainly carbon and oxygen) and a quantum gas of electrons travelling near the
			speed of light.  The core is covered with an atmosphere (of similar thickness to our
			own) containing mainly hydrogen and/or helium.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			Most white dwarfs are relatively hot which makes them appear blue compared to
			other stars, but their small size makes them intrinsically faint.  They slowly
			cool as they radiate away their internal energy, causing their radiation to shift
			to longer wavelengths (become redder) over time.  The observed distribution of white
			dwarf temperatures provides an important constraint on the age of our galaxy.
		</p>

  		  <a href="images/pjmo.jpg" rel="lightbox[images]" title="The UT system mounted on the 24&quot; telescope at Meyer Observatory"><img src="images/pjmo_thumb.jpg" width="150" /></a>
		</div></div>	
		<p align="justify">
			As they cool, there are certain temperature regimes where the outflowing
			energy is able to interact with the hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere
			to drive complicated pulsations.  The strong gravity of white dwarfs mean
			that these pulsations are largely non-radial.
			These pulsations manifest as periodic temperature variations at the surface,
			which cause the apparant brightness of the star to change on timescales of
			a few minutes.  These brightness variations are made up of many sinusoidal
			frequencies which are related to the internal structure of the star.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			We are able to identify the frequencies that a star pulsates at by measuring
			its intensity over time and using the Fourier transform to find the equivalent
			sinusoids that it contains.  These frequencies can then be used to constrain
			numerical models of white dwarf interiors to indirectly measure important
			physical charactersics of the star.  Some stars show non-sinusoidal pulsations,
			which is related to convection within the stellar atmosphere.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			The short timescale of the pulsations means that we must continuosly measure
			intensities with integrations of tens of seconds.  Most white dwarf research is
			done with ~1m class telescopes, and so it is important to have an efficient
			photometer that makes the most of the limited number of photons available.

		<h3>Instrumentation</h3>
		<div class="imageRow" style="float:right; margin-right:5px;"><div class="single">
  			<a href="images/timer.jpg" rel="lightbox[images]" title="The Puoko-nui timer unit">
			<img src="images/timer_thumb.jpg" width="200" /></a>
		</div></div>
		<p align="justify">
			We have developed a flexible photometer system for measuring the intensity of
			variable stars.  The photometer integrates an off-the-shelf
			<abbr title="Charge-Coupled Device">CCD</abbr> camera and
			<abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> receiver with custom timing
			electronics and software for instrument control and data analysis.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			Two variants of the instrument exist with different cameras.  The original
			<abbr title="Victoria University of Wellington">VUW</abbr> system uses a Princeton
			Instruments MicroMax CCD, and is used with the 1m telescope at
			<a href="http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/research/mt_john/index.shtml">Mt John University Observatory</a>.
			A second instrument is operated by the White Dwarf group at the
			<a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/astronomy.html">University of Texas in Austin</a>.
			This instrument uses a Princeton Instruments ProEM CCD, and has been used
			with the 82" and 36" telescopes at
			<a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/mcdonald/mcdonald.html">McDonald Observatory</a>
			and the 24" telescope at
			<a href="http://www.centexastronomy.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=901132&module_id=8135">Meyer Observatory</a>.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			The CCDs in both instruments are back-illuminated 1024&times;1024px
			frame-transfer CCDs.  The back-illumination provides exceptional quantum
			efficiency in the blue wavelengths emitted by hot white dwarfs, and the
			frame-transfer operation allows the cameras to be operated without a
			mechanical shutter, further increasing the photon collecting ability of
			the system.
		</p>
			
		<p align="justify">
			Our timing hardware is built around an Atmel AVR microprocessor (similar
			to those used in the Arduino platform) which communicates with an external
			GPS receiver.  Precise exposure timing is available with a 1 millisecond
			resolution for exposures less than 65 seconds, or 1 second resolution for
			longer intervals. More information (including hardware specifications and
			source code) is available in the
			<a href="https://github.com/pchote/Karaka" target="_blank">Karaka repository</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p align="justify">
			Instrument control software has been developed to run under Linux and
			Windows.  More information (including source code) is available in the
			<a href="https://github.com/pchote/Puoko-nui" target="_blank">Puoko-nui repository</a>.

			<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">tsreduce</span> analyses data as
			it is acquired to provide real-time analysis of the target star.  It performs
			differential aperture photometry on the target star plus several comparison
			stars to remove the effect of cloud and transparency variations.  The online
			reduction display includes raw intensities, an estimate of the current
			atmospheric seeing, and time-series and Fourier Transform of the target star.
			More information is available in the
			<a href="https://github.com/pchote/tsreduce">tsreduce repository</a>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
			We have also developed a microprocessor unit used to drive
			<abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s in a light-box for bench-testing
			the instrument and online reduction. More information is available in the
			<a href="https://github.com/pchote/star-simulator">Star Simulator repository</a>.
