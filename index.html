				<h3>White Dwarf Stars</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					Stars exist as a balance between gravity pulling in and energy created by
					nuclear fusion pushing out.  When a star runs out of nuclear fuel this outward force
					ceases, and the star will evolve into a small and extremely dense object. Depending
					on their mass they will become a white
					dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.  The vast majority of stars (over 97%) are
					predicted to end their lives as a white dwarf.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					The forces sustaining a white dwarf are dominated by quantum and relativistic effects.
					They contain a core about the size of the Earth     which contains a classical gas of
					nuclides (mainly carbon and oxygen) and a quantum gas of electrons travelling near the
					speed of light.  The core is covered with an atmosphere (of similar thickness to our
					own) containing mainly hydrogen and/or helium.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Most white dwarfs are hot which makes them appear blue compared to
					other stars, but their small size means that they are usually very faint.  They slowly
					cool as they radiate away their internal energy, causing their radiation to shift
					to longer wavelengths (become redder) over time.  The observed distribution of white
					dwarf temperatures/colours provides an important constraint on the age of our galaxy.
				</p>
				<div class="imageRow" style="float:left; margin-left:5px;"><div class="single">
					<a href="images/pjmo.jpg" rel="lightbox[images]" title="The UT system mounted on the 24&quot; telescope at Meyer Observatory">
					<img src="images/pjmo_thumb.jpg" width="150" /></a>
				</div></div>
				<p align="justify">
					As they cool, there are certain temperature regimes where the outflowing
					energy is able to interact with the hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere
					to drive complicated pulsations.  The strong gravity at the surface of a
					white dwarfs mean that these pulsations are largely non-radial.
					These pulsations manifest as periodic temperature variations at the surface,
					made up of many sinusoidal frequencies, which cause the apparant brightness
					of the star to change on timescales of a few minutes.  The spectrum of
					frequencies within the pulsations are related to the internal structure and
					composition of the star.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					We are able to identify the frequencies that a star pulsates at by measuring
					its intensity over time and using the Fourier transform to find the equivalent
					sinusoids that it contains.  These frequencies can then be used to constrain
					numerical models of white dwarf interiors to indirectly measure important
					physical charactersics of the star.  Some stars show non-sinusoidal pulsations,
					which is related to convection within the stellar atmosphere.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					The short timescale of the pulsations means that we must continuosly monitor
					a single star with integrations of tens of seconds.  Most white dwarf research is
					done with ~1m class telescopes, so it is important to have an efficient
					photometer that makes the most of the limited number of photons that these faint
					stars emit.
				</p>

				<h3>Instrumentation</h3>
				<div class="imageRow" style="float:right; margin-right:5px;"><div class="single">
					<a href="images/timer.jpg" rel="lightbox[images]" title="The Puoko-nui timer unit">
					<img src="images/timer_thumb.jpg" width="200" /></a>
				</div></div>
				<p align="justify">
					We have developed a flexible photometer system for measuring the intensity of
					variable stars.  The photometer integrates an off-the-shelf
					<abbr title="Charge-Coupled Device">CCD</abbr> camera and
					<abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> receiver with custom timing
					electronics and software for instrument control and data analysis.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Two variants of the instrument exist with different cameras.  The original
					system operated at <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/scps">VUW</a> uses a Princeton
					Instruments MicroMax CCD, and is used with the 1m telescope at
					<a href="http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/research/mt_john/index.shtml">Mt John University Observatory</a>.
					A second instrument is operated by the White Dwarf group at the
					<a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/astronomy.html">University of Texas in Austin</a>.
					This instrument uses a Princeton Instruments ProEM CCD, and has been used
					with the 82" and 36" telescopes at
					<a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/mcdonald/mcdonald.html">McDonald Observatory</a>
					and the 24" telescope at
					<a href="http://www.centexastronomy.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=901132&module_id=8135">Meyer Observatory</a>.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					The CCDs in both instruments are back-illuminated 1024&times;1024px
					frame-transfer CCDs.  The back-illumination provides exceptional quantum
					efficiency in the blue wavelengths emitted by hot white dwarfs, and the
					frame-transfer operation allows the cameras to be operated without a
					mechanical shutter, further increasing the photon collecting ability of
					the system.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Our timing hardware is built around an Atmel AVR microprocessor (similar
					to those used in the Arduino platform) which communicates with an external
					GPS receiver, the acquisition PC, and the CCD.  Precise exposure timing is
					available with a 1 millisecond resolution for exposures less than 65 seconds,
					or 1 second resolution for longer intervals.

					<a href="images/acquisition.png" rel="lightbox[images]" title="The acquisition software and online reduction while observing the pulsating white dwarf L19-2">

				</div></div>
				<p align="justify">
					<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">tsreduce</span> provides real-time
					analysis of the acquired data.  It performs     differential aperture photometry
					on the target star plus several comparison stars to remove the effect of cloud
					and other atmospheric effects.  The reduction display shows the raw intensities,
					differential photometry of the target star, an estimate of the atmospheric seeing,
					and a Fourier Transform of the target pulsations.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					We have developed a second AVR based unit for controlling the intensity of
					<abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s in a light-tight box, which allows
					the instrument and reduction software to be tested on the bench. We are currently
					adapting this work for an undergraduate physics experiment on CCDs and timeseries
					photometery.
